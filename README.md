# leet-code-in-go
- A series of leet code problems solutions using Golang. Not in any particular order.
- Each branch is related to one problem, and represents a solution for this problem.
- Different commits may exist with different implementations.
- Branches can contain code explanations in the `README.md` file.

# Problem: 58\. Length of Last Word
- Given a string s consisting of words and spaces, return the length of the last word in the string.
- A word is a maximal substring consisting of non-space characters only.

# First thoughts:
- Analyze the string from the end. (inverted loop)
- Stop when space is found.
- Trim extra spaces.
- Count the letters.

# Approach:
-

# Key:
-

# Complexity:
- Time: $$O(1 + n)$$
- Space: $$O(1 + n)$$

# Constraints:
- (1 <= s.length <= 10^4)
- s consists of only English letters and spaces ' '.
- There will be at least one word in s.

# Optimizations:
-
